A word of warning, violent descriptions ahead.
**********************************************





The summer passes fitfully, it can hardly be remembered. Some dreams
disappear as swiftly as a melting glacier and some nightmares stalk
invisibly, affecting though spectral, lost to time, blocked out as
though erased on recall. I can hardly help my golem-like demeanor,
saying little and moving forward  with decisions I have no business
making. It is a time of great numbness! And soon I am back in that
infernal world, that hot steaming jungle, in a small one room with an
inflatable mattress. Planning, yes. Revenge, or something like it.
There can be no surety of my intentions, for even I am not sure of
them. I know that I now carry a knife, an old rusted thing, small
enough to palm in the hand and on the blade an etching that says ‘Old
Timer.’ It is difficult to open, this knife, and one might doubt
its effectiveness in combat, it being so short and thin, but you must
remember to be smart. It takes nothing more than this to plunge
straight into an eye socket and gouge out the ball! No, you need
nothing more. Only the desire to do it. The nerve. The inclination!
If your knife is small go for the eyes. Be prepared for such an
eventuality.
