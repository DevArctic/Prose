MOYNAHAN

I mean no great offense, my stalwart friend,
I simply wish to come to a decree,
Or resolution worthy this complaint.
As I have understood it breeds suspicion
Upon us all as brothers, friends, both Jew
and Gentile, came we here to learn and walk
Amongst diverse and varied views and creeds,
We do a great disservice to that lot when we
Go on in brash dismissal of each other’s thoughts!

ELIAS

What manner of word flips and tricks are these,
We out ourselves and call to arms on facts,
Not dimly held beliefs of others’ dreams,
Is not this crime assaultive, brash and rude?
Are you not shocked that such intolerance
Comes fast and furious wherever Jews are found?
Are you not made to anger finding this,
This hateful thing, revealing lower minds
Who must be hiding, even now, today,
As cowards, shaking, laughing, eating cheese
They stole from a child, who cries unseen, un-heard?

MOYNAHAN

I hold, perhaps this act, means less than that.
And speaks on something other than on Jews

ELIAS

A swastika? What other meaning, friend?

MOYNAHAN

'Tis nothing but a dream, appointed friend,
That's all it is, is my protracted mind
Devouring the day's events and vomiting back
What it ingested. I'm sorry that I woke you.

KAHLIL

And why do you persist on *Jewish* thoughts?
What brings to mind that group, despite all others?

MOYNAHAN

I may have done a wrongful thing to Jews.
A crime to them in passing, without a thought.

KAHLIL

What crime is this? On who and when-abouts?

MOYNAHAN

I must not say. There's more to this than my
buffoonish guilt. Perhaps, I lack the will
To rob a man of his small peace of mind
Forget it all occurred, and move along.

KAHLIL

You speak in riddles, now, like an old man.
You mustn't let such things engulf your mind,
We all are swimming through a sea of feelings,
Trudging a path through murky swamps diverse.
Do sleep on this: How quick us apes forget.
