Glumly,
I sit amongst the towering smoke-stacks, wide rimmed pipes and
pipettes, billowing vapors like the columns of a great
machine-factory, and next to me she is, her black hair straight and
thin, asking the flavors of the various tablets, watching as the
white and grey clouds envelop and then dissipate inside the venue,
all sick in its existence. There is chittering, chattering, talking
amongst the groups here seated, though no discernible topic can be
heard through the milieu, and hardly anything can be heard over the
pounding bass, and the strobe light, and lasers, all these toys.
Phones in peopleâ€™s hands, glowing bricks. The boy across from me
with a full beard smiles as he exhales and the scent of bubblegum and
tar drifts across the table. Norah says something to my right. I look
at her.
