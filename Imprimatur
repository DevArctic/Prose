And you! You, who so well know the nature of my soul, you are the only
one who could possibly understand, if there is anything to understand at
all, do not judge, though I feel it in you, no do not rise above me, nor 
separate yourself from me, please, all I can askis that you come down with 
me and delve deep into the Earth, let yourself be consumed by the horror of 
it all, and I tell you, it is horror we were playing with, like children, 
and don’t you have pity for children who play with guns? We were simply 
unaware of the enormity of madness, the pure being of terror, you understand, 
don’t you? In any case I was not so involved. I was not the one to do the
deed. Gathered together through the auspices of education, and nobility,
and academia! We are all so young and yet it
feels as if we are all worldly, and changed forever, marked, or –
better yet – anointed into a new life, a better life, a life above
others. Or perhaps this was just me. Perhaps it is only myself who
feels such airs, who pins this new experience on himself like so many
medals from the battlefield. I have already succeeded in life, just
to be here, there is no more work involved, no more toil, only smooth
sailing into a brave new world wherein I am to be crowned. What new
people this world brings to me! Their many faces shuffle past my
door, introducing themselves.
